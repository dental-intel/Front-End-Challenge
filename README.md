## Dental Intelligence - Front End Coding Challenge

# Weather App

This is a chance to challenge your creativity and coding prowess, by building a JavaScript application to display weather information. The User Interface you develop should prompt the user for a location, and display the resulting weather. There are several free weather APIs available to choose from. Pick one, consume it, and display the information you feel is relevant, if you can use a location API as well to prepopulate the city as you type - even better!

This is an open challenge and does not have a single expected solution. It is just to see how you think about and solve problems, but we want this to be something that you would be proud to deploy to production.
Code should be submitted via a public Github repo and we will review it with you as part of a technical interview. Please include a README.md file with instructions you think will be necessary for us to run your solution.

- A few examples of free weather APIs:

  - https://openweathermap.org/current​ (1000 free calls/day 60/min)
  - http://apidev.accuweather.com/developers/​ (50 free calls/day)
  - https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

- Things we care about:
  - Does it work?
  - General architecture of the solution.
  - Expected technologies: Typescript, SPA Framework (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte etc....)
  - Unit tests where applicable (if possible)

Important Constraint​: While packages may exist to wrap calls to the API you choose, we want you to make the REST API calls yourself without using a wrapper. This helps us evaluate how well you can translate a vendor’s API documentation into customer value. We do, however encourage using other packages for making HTTP requests, parsing JSON, and other needs.
